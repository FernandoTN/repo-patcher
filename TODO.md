3. **The system operates within cost constraints** (â‰¤$0.50 per fix) at scale
4. **Safety guardrails prevent any destructive changes** to repositories
5. **Developers actively use and recommend the tool** for their daily workflows
6. **The tool demonstrates clear ROI** by saving developer time and reducing technical debt

**The ultimate vision**: A reliable AI pair programmer that developers trust to fix their failing tests, allowing them to focus on building new features rather than debugging test failures.
